class *bibliopixel.drivers.APA102.APA102*
=========================================

APA102 is for controlling APA102 (Adafruit's DotStar) strips on devices
that have hardware SPI ports, like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black.
The majority of its implementation and properties exist in
[[DriverSPIBase]]. See [[SPI Setup]] for more details.

**Note:** SPI devices typically require root access in order to write to
the SPI port. Any scripts using this class should be run with *sudo*.

\_\_init\_\_
^^^^^^^^^^^^

(num, c\_order = ChannelOrder.RGB, use\_py\_spi = True,
dev="/dev/spidev0.0", SPISpeed = 16)

-  **num** - Number of pixels to be controlled.
-  **c\_order** - Optional: Channel order used by the attached display.
   Can be any of the six options in the ChannelOrder class. See
   [[Channel Order\|Display-Setup#channel-order]] for more details.
-  **use\_py\_spi** - If True, SPI communication is handled by
   `py-spidev <https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev>`__ which provides
   faster output. Otherwise a file access method is used.
-  **dev** - The SPI device path to use. See [[SPI Setup]] for more
   details.
-  **SPISpeed** - The SPI speed, in MHz, to use when communicating with
   the strip.
