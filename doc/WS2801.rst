class *bibliopixel.drivers.WS2801.WS2801*
=========================================

WS2801 is for controlling WS2801 strips on devices that have hardware
SPI ports, like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black. The majority of
its implementation and properties exist in [[DriverSPIBase]]. See [[SPI
Setup]] for more details.

**Note:** SPI devices typically require root access in order to write to
the SPI port. Any scripts using this class should be run with *sudo*.

\_\_init\_\_
^^^^^^^^^^^^

(num, c\_order = ChannelOrder.RGB, use\_py\_spi = True,
dev="/dev/spidev0.0", SPISpeed = 1)

-  **num** - Number of pixels to be controlled.
-  **c\_order** - Optional: Channel order used by the attached display.
   Can be any of the six options in the ChannelOrder class. See
   [[Channel Order\|Display-Setup#channel-order]] for more details.
-  **use\_py\_spi** - If True, SPI communication is handled by
   `py-spidev <https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev>`__ which provides
   faster output. Otherwise a file access method is used.
-  **dev** - The SPI device path to use. See [[SPI Setup]] for more
   details.
-  **SPISpeed** - The SPI speed, in MHz, to use when communicating with
   the strip. The WS2801 technically has a maximum clock speed of 25MHz
   but in practice rarely runs well beyond 1MHz, which the driver
   defaults to. Changing the SPI speed for WS2801 is not recommended.
